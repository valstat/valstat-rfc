# Valstat is a Response Protocol

 *"... If you look at the source of your program, you'll notice routines that you call, but which you didn't implement..." -- Peter Van Der Linden*

## Why Valstat?

*As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.* â€”Maurice Wilkes discovers bugs, 1949 

Ultimately this is an effort to help eradicate programming errors. After a lot of time spent being involved in all levels of computer programming, I might humbly add to Mr Wilkes observation: Very early in the process we have discovered that not every programmer knows exactly how to implement the requirement and is equally likely not fully able to do so. Why?

This is not because programmers are less able to understand or learn. This is because programmers are very often supposed to implement what an software development lack of organization sends the programmers way.

Software diagnostics tools, testing concepts and programming idioms, are necessary to decouple from a constant and sometimes dramatic change in project surroundings. Or simply, lack of clear requirements.

Also. Safe code is slow(er).Dangerous code is fast(er). valstat might help in that proverbial balancing act.Especially in modern distributed systems made up of legacy and modern components, developed in various languages or developed by various organizations.

## Paradigm

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)
-->
Valstat is a protocol and an software architecture paradigm. Valstat is not yet another error handling idiom. More precisely valstat as a protocol, is a paradigm shift about unified logic of creating a call response and handling the payload returned.
<!--
## Scope

The scope of Valstat is ambitious: from the micro code level, to the macro, inter system level.

> Every caller has a responder&trade;

# Documentation

valstat documentation is deliberately technical, short and to the point. Prose is left to be authored in future texts in response to future criticisms, comments and clarification requirements.

> valstat protocol is designed to be platform and language agnostic.

There is a root document describing the protocol and core concepts. There is also a number of repositories describing the various implementations in few widely used programing languages. 

1. valstat Protocol
   1. The language agnostic, conceptual, [root document](VALSTAT.md)
2. c implementation
   1. planned ISO WG14 proposal 
3. c++ implementation
   1. [ISO committee WG21](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/901) ([LEWG](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/LEWG)) [Proposal P2192](P2192R4.md)
4. javascript implementation
5. c# implementation
6. go implementation

> Together a protocol and its implementation are assembling an behavior pattern.
