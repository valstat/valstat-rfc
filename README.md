# Valstat is a Kind-of-a-Contract 

## Call Response Agreement

 *"... If you look at the source of your program, you'll notice routines that you call, but which you didn't implement..." -- Peter Van Der Linden*
<!--
## Why Valstat?

*As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent finding mistakes in my programs.* â€”Maurice Wilkes discovers bugs, 1949 

Ultimately this is an effort to help eradicate programming errors. After a lot of time spent being involved in all levels of computer programming, I might humbly add to Mr Wilke's observation: Very early in the process, we have discovered that not every programmer knows exactly how to implement the requirement and is equally likely not fully able to do so. Why?

This is not because programmers are less able to understand or learn. This is because programmers are very often supposed to implement what a software development lack of organization sends the programmer's way.

Software diagnostics tools, testing concepts, and programming idioms are necessary to decouple from a constant and sometimes dramatic change in project surroundings. Or simply, a lack of clear requirements.

Also. Safe code is slow(er). Dangerous code is fast(er). valstat might help in that proverbial balancing act. Especially in modern distributed systems made up of legacy and modern components, developed in various languages or developed by various organizations.

## Paradigm

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)
-->
Valstat is a software architecture paradigm. Valstat is not yet another error-handling idiom. More precisely valstat as a protocol, is a paradigm shift in unified logic of creating a call response and handling the payload returned.
<!--
## Scope

The scope of Valstat is ambitious: from the microcode level to the macro, inter-system level.

## I am in a rush
OK, here you are. In the language you need to use, implement valstat as a light structure of two fields. The **field** in many business systems  languages is `option<T>`; it can be empty or occupied; when not empty it has a value of type T. Call the first field `Value` and the second field `Status`

```cpp
// VALSTAT pseudo code synopsys
{
   option value
   option status
}
```
you call the function and it returns such a structure. You use it in two steps:

1. what is the call outcome?
2. depending on the outcome what is the value (if any) or what is the status (if any)

The key is: that every interface method has to return valstat type. Everybody has to agree on the Valstat two-step usage. That also dictates how are valstats made. Everybody can be a team, a project, a system, a company, or wider than that. The wider the better. One can return valstat types using JSON, HTTP, XML, SQL, or whatever else.

# Documentation

valstat documentation is deliberately technical, short, and to the point. The prose is left to be authored in future texts in response to future criticisms, comments, and clarification requirements.

> valstat concept is designed to be platform and language-agnostic.

There is a root document describing the core concepts. There is also a number of repositories describing the various implementations in a few widely used programming languages. 

1. valstat Concept
   1. The language agnostic, conceptual, [root document](VALSTAT.md)
2. c implementation
   1. planned ISO WG14 proposal 
3. c++ implementation
   1. [ISO committee WG21](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/901) ([LEWG](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/labels/LEWG)) [Proposal P2192](P2192R4.md)
4. javascript implementation
5. c# implementation
6. go implementation

> Together a concept and its implementation are making a behavior pattern.
