There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. -- [C.A.R. Hoare](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/C._A._R._Hoare)

## 1. Abstract

This is a proposal about logical, feasible, lightweight and effective handling of information returned from functions, based on an paradigm shift.

This paper proposes an Architecture and implementation of a solution to a part of deeply rooted ISO C++ issues [[3](#ref3)][[15](#ref15)]. Implemented for and by C++ adopters, this would be a tiny std library citizen without any language change required.

<span id="motivation" />

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

## 2. Motivation 

### 2.1. Standard returns handling is missing

As of today, in the std lib, there are few (or more than few) **error** handling paradigms, idioms and return types. Accumulated through decades, from ancient to old. None of them dealing with general function returns in an satisfactory manner. Together they have inevitably contributed to a rising technical debt present inside C++ std lib. 

What is "Returns handling"? Returns handling is the next step in evolution of error handling. It is the true picture of real life code. Returns handling is widely deployed in API consuming algorithms, required to deal with wider scope of issues, opposed to a simple "error or no error", boolean logic. 

There is none in the std lib of such pervasive paradigm or mechanism. Dotted on the wast C++ std lib landscape there are some attempts to the returns handling solutions.

But none of them serves the customers returns handling requirements. Think HTTP codes handling algorithms, as an well known example. Lack of a common and ubiquitous non trivial returns handling recommendation or solutions is raising the level of complexity for all levels of application architectures developed with standard C++. 

Motivation is to aid solving three core requirements categories

<h2>Requirement categories, across domains</h2>

1. Run-Time
2. Interoperability
3. Energy

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

### 2.2. Run-Time 

Perhaps the key reason for appearance of C++ dialects, are to be found in std lib perceived inability to address the strict run-time requirements. That essentially means developing using the C++ core language but [without the std lib](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL). [[1](#ref1)]

One motivation of this paper is to try and offer an "over arching", but simple enough, returns handling paradigm applicable across the C++ landscape. Including fast growing C++ dialects, fragmenting away the industry and markets relying on existence of the standard C++. 

**Minimal list** of requirements (for ISO C++ based projects)

1. can not use try / throw / catch[[6](#ref6)][[15](#ref15)] 
2. can not use \<system_error\>[[14](#ref14)]
3. do not use `iostreams`

 For details, authoritative references are provided. Author will be so bold not to delve into the reasons and background of this list, in order to keep this paper simple and focused. Gaming, embedded systems, high performance, mission critical computing, are just the tip of the iceberg.

### 2.3. Interoperability

Each traditional solution to those strict run-time requirements is one nail in the coffin of interoperability. In danger of sounding like offering an panacea,  author will also draw the attention to the malleability of the metastate paradigm to be implemented with wide variety of languages used in developing components of an modern distributed system. 

Usability of an API is measured on all levels: from the code level, to the distributed system level. In order to design an API to be **feasibly** usable it has to be interoperable. That leads to three core requirements of

Interoperable API core requirements (to start with)

1. no "error code" as return value
   1. Complexity arises from "special" error codes multiplied with different types multiplied with different context
   2. In turn increasing the learning curve for every function in every API
   3. How to decode the error code, becomes a prominent issue
        4. Think Windows: `NTSTATUS`, `HRESULT`, `GetCode()`, `errno`
2. no "return arguments" aka "reference arguments" in C++.
   1. type specific mutable argument solutions are definitely not interoperable.  
3. no special globals
   1. Think errno legacy 
   2. pure functions can not use globals

Some of the designed-in simplicity in this paper is an result of deliberate attempt to increase the interoperability (also with other run-time environments and languages). 

It is important to understand the inter domain interoperability requirements, not just using standard C++. Examples: [WASM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm), [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html), [Android](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code) and such. 

### 2.4. Energy 

This is operational environment requirement. Operational environment can be satellite in an orbit, or a data center. 

Side info: it is not just energy consumption to run servers, it is also energy required to [cool the data-center hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling) down.

Solving data centers large energy consumption has become an imperative. Most of the server side software is written in C/C++ . Pressure is on, to design and develop using standard C++ but also with energy consumption as an primary requirement. 

[This one is not a "simple" requirement](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01496266/document). [Somewhat paradoxically](https://youtu.be/koTf7u0v41o) this category of requirements requires less and less code and more and more performance in the same time. Smaller code and smaller executables means less energy spent on that executable running and CPU cooling.

## 3. metastate

When calling ISO C++ API's returning `std::optional`, users are already modelling two stages: 

- stage one -- Is something retuned? 
- stage two -- Can I use it?   

Conceptually metastate paradigm belongs to the same category of the "two stage" return processing paradigms.

- Stage one: use metastates to determine the outcome
    - not using the type system
- Stage two: use the content returned
    - using the type system

In a way same as `std::optional` but without it, so it can be applied across many domains.

### 3.1. Field

Let us postulate the existence of a function: 
```cpp
 // returns true if field is empty
       bool is_empty( Field ) ;
```
That function is letting us know what is the state of occupancy of an "field". But what is this "Field thing" ?

C++ "field" is analogous to the database field. The name "field" is the name for an  "single piece of information", in database theory also known as "field". "field" in the database is what in C++ is: *"a particular piece of data encapsulated within a class or object"* [ref [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(computer_science))]. 

#### 3.1.1. Occupancy states

Field can be in two "occupancy states"(authors term) . We will call them : "empty" and "occupied". It is a well known and adopted fact: database field always exist, but it can be empty.

`std::optional` is a well known implementation of a C++ field, sometimes known as "container of one". It's instance is an object holding only one variable defined in it. It might be tested if it is empty; "not holding a value". Or, occupied or "holding a value".

### 3.2. Definition

> Metastate is the foundation to the family of returns handling idioms.

As meta-language is language of languages, **metastate** is "state of states". metastate is an boolean AND combination of occupancy states of two fields. Named: Value and Status. A bit more formally.

```
; two possible occupancy states
empty     ::= true | false
has_value ::= true | false
occupancy_state ::== empty | has_value
; field is made of
; occupancy state and value
field ::=  occupancy_state AND value
; 'value' and 'status' are fields
value  ::= field
status ::= field

; metastate is AND combination of 
; two fields occupancy states
; combination of occupancy_states of two fields
metastate ::= is_empty(value) AND is_empty(status)

; valstat is a record made of two fields
valsat ::= value AND status
``` 
Combination of value *and* status occupancies is giving four possible metastates. We will label them for further use, in stage one of returns processing.

| Meta State Label | Value occupancy  | op | Status occupancy  |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| **Info**  | Has value | AND | Has value |
| **OK**    | Has value | AND | Empty     |
| **Error** | Empty     | AND | Has value |
| **Empty** | Empty     | AND | Empty     |

metastate labels are just that: labels, they are just indicating the behaviour. 

That is it. That is the core, adopters can use when solving their requirements listed in the Motivation section. Put in some simple C++ code, metastate idea is really rather simple and easy to comprehend.  

> In adopting the metastate paradigm we do not immediately inspect returned values, we inspect the relationship of two fields returned first.

```cpp
// there is no special type returned
// both returns are fields 
// metastates are captured AND-ing their occupancy states
// metastates are used in stage one of returns processing
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();
```
Like in the most other languages, in C++ there is no need for existence of some dedicated metastate type.  We only care about the relationship between two fields states of occupancy.

Metastate capturing is the stage one of metastates processing. Metastate capturing is the act of decoding the relationship between occupancy states of its two fields. Following is canonical capturing of the four possible metastates, in some pseudo code :

```cpp
// pseudo code
// two fields are input into the idiom of
// capturing all four possible metastates
// This is stage one of return processing
// In stage one types or values of the
// content returned are not used
// they are irrelevant in stage one
// 
  if (   is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) &&   is_empty( status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! is_empty( value ) && ! is_empty( status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
That is not C++ but it can be. As well as it can be many other languages: C, JavaScript, Python, Java etc. In standard C++ reality we do not need `is_empty()` function from above. We can use `std::optional` as a readily available field type.
```cpp
// C++ code
// fields are std::optional instances
// this is still stage one
// we do not need content, just two fields
// occupancy states
auto [value, status] = metastate_enabled_function ();

  if (   value &&   status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   value && ! status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! value &&   status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! value && ! status )  { /* empty*/ }
```

As return is neatly divided in two stages, metastate serves well for arriving to cleaner idioms for complex returns handling. The aded benefits are immediate applicability and ability in addressing the requirements from the [Motivation section](#motivation): strict runtime, applicability across domains, of both languages and processes. And lastly arriving to a more energy friendly C++ coded executables.[[6](#ref6)] 

**What this has to do with std lib?**

This proposal's value also lies in deliberate simplicity, aiding in solving the strict operational requirements and interoperability.

Modern software architectures are clusters of interoperating but separated components. Thorny not-a-detail is universally applicable returns handling, across language and system  barriers.  And this is where metastate as a paradigm might help. (Think JSON with metastate inside) 

Universal adoption of the metastate paradigm, would be greatly aided by placing one tiny template in the standard C++ std lib. This proposal requires no changes in the core language. Truth to be told there is not a single type proposed. Just one template.

<!-- div class="page"/ -->

## 4. valstat

 > valstat is an transparent metastates carrier 

In order to achieve the required wide scope of the metastate paradigm, it has to be simple. Metastate actual programming language shape has to be completely context free. Put simply the C++ std lib implementation must not dictate the usage beside supporting the paradigm. 

"valstat" is a name of the C++ template, offering the greatest possible degree of freedom for metastate C++ adopters. Implementation is simplest possible, resilient, lightweight and feasible. Almost transparent.

The only requirement is to give callers, the opportunity to capture the four metastates, returned by some "meta state enabled" API. 

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

*std::valstat\<T,S\>* as a template is an generic interface whose aliases and definitions allow the easy metastates capturing by examining the state of occupancy of the 'value' and 'status' fields.

```cpp
#pragma once
// std lib header: <valstat>
namespace std 
{
 template< typename V, typename S >
	struct [[nodiscard]] valstat
 {
    // both types must be able to 
    // simply and resiliently
    // exhibit state of occupancy
    // "empty" or "has value"
		using value_field_type  = V ;
		using status_field_type = S ;

    // metastate is captured by combining
    // state of occupancy of these two fields

		value_field_type   value;
		status_field_type  status;
 };
} // std
```
*std::valstat* will be assuring the metastate presence in the realm of standard C++ as an recommendation. It will not mandate its usage in any way. It should be in a separate header *\<valstat\>*, to allow for complete decoupling from any of the std lib types and headers. LEt us repeat: `std::valstat` is a recommendation. Metastate paradigm can be implemented in many ways in C++ and many other languages.

**Type requirements**

Both value and status field types, should offer an simple mechanism that reveals their occupancy state. Readily available example of that behaviour is [std::optional<T>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional). 

In specific contexts a native pointer or any other type can server the same purpose, as it will be explained. What is the meaning of "empty" for a particular C++ type, and what is not, depends on the context. Please see an [example in the appendix](#82-fully-functional-valstat-type-not-using-stdoptional-and-not-using-stdvalstat)

<span id="my_valstat" ></span>

### 4.1. my::valstat 

Is an `std::valstat` "natural" variation we will actually use in examples in this proposal. We will solve the occupancy requirement imposed on valstat fields by simply using `std::optional`. No thousands of lines of C++ is required for some special type. No need to be concerned about the implementation complexity[[13](#ref13)]. 

```cpp
// adopters namespace 
namespace my {
// ready to operate on almost any type
// std::optional rules permitting
template<typename T, typename S>
using valstat = std::valstat< 
         std::optional<T>, 
         std::optional<S> >;
} // my
```
In standard C++ view of `my::valstat` it is not wrong to relax a metastate definition, as an "AND combination" of two `std::optional`'s.

Now both API code and API callers (of the `my` namespace) have the universal readily applicable valstat, as an simple template alias. 

Most of the time valstat C++ users will use a structured binding. Let's see some ad-hoc examples of `my::valstat` direct usage, no functions involved yet:
```cpp
   // OK metastate created
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, {} };

// OK metastate captured
// stage one: compare the fields occupancy
	if ( value && ! status ) {
      /* stage two: use the status value from inside a field instance */
		std::cout << "OK metastate captured, value is: " << *value ;
	}
```
If required, the other three metastates wil be created like so:
```cpp
   // both fields are std::option<int> instances
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY
	auto [ value, status ] = my::valstat< int, int >{ {}, 42 }; // ERROR
```
### 4.2. bare-bones valstat 

After all this postulating, field theory and such, it might come as a surprise, in some circumstances it is quite ok and enough to be using fundamental types for both value and status fields. 

In a way we apply the std::optional or the "field" concept by using just fundamental types.

For example let us consider some very strict embedded system, run-time environment.
```cpp
   // valstat but not as we know it
   struct valstat_int_int final {
      int value;
      int status;
   };

   // both value and status fields in here are int's
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ 42, {} }; // OK

// OK metastate captured
// (42 && !0 ) yields true
if ( value && ! status ) { uplink( value ) ; }

// other three metastates, if required
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ 42, 42 }; // INFO
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ {}, {} }; // EMPTY
	auto [ value, status ] = valstat_int_int{ {}, 42 }; // ERROR

```
That is still metastate creating and capturing. It is only, in some context valstat field types can be two simple int's. We have declared in that context only, we will think of int as empty if it is zero. 
```cpp
// in some specific context int is "empty" if it is zero
bool is_empty( int val_ ) {   return ! val_ ; }
```
Above is rather important metastate ability for projects mentioned in the motivation section as that solution is not using std lib and is working under extremely tight conditions. The already mentioned [example in the appendix](#82-fully-functional-valstat-type-not-using-stdoptional-and-not-using-stdvalstat), shows something different but similar.

<!-- div class="page"/ -->

## 5. Usage

It is admittedly hard to immediately see the connection between metastate and valstat, and the somewhat bold promises about wide spectrum of benefits, presented in the [motivation section](#motivation). 

There are many equally simple and convincing examples of metastate usage benefits. In order to keep this core proposal short we will first observe just one, but illustrative use-case. [Appendix A](#8-appendix-a) contains few more. 

### 5.1. Callers point of view

Recap. Returns handling: valstat instance carries (out of the function) information to be utilized by callers capturing the metastate. How and why (or why not) is the metastate capturing code shaped, that completely depends on the project adopting it, the API logic and many other requirements dictated by adopters architects and developers. 

Example bellow might be used by adopters operating on some database. In this illustration, adopters use the metastate to pass back (to the caller) full information, obtained after the database field fetching operation. Again, there is no 'special' over-elaborated return type required. That is a good thing. Metastate is a paradigm, there is no 'metastate' type just idioms of metastates capturing. 

 ```cpp
 // declaration of a metastate emitting function
 // or valstat returning function
 template<typename T>
// we use the `my::valstat` type. 
// `my::stat` is code value from some code/message mechanism.
   my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
   full_field_info
   (database::row /*row_*/ , std::string_view /* field_name */ ) 
// valstat carry no exception throwing requirements   
   noexcept ;
```
Primary objective is enabling callers comprehension of a full information passed out of the function. Returns, not just error handling. Satisfying the core requirements from the [motivation section](#2-motivation). 
```cpp
// full return handling after 
// the attempted value retrieval
// from the database 
// value and status are valstat fields
auto [ value, status ] = full_field_info<int>( db_row, field_name ) ;
```
In this scenario caller is capturing all four metastates.
```cpp
if (   value &&   status )  { 
   // metastate captured: info 
   std::cout << "\nSpecial value found: " << *value ;
   // *status type is my::stat
   std::cout << "\nStatus is: " << my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

if (   value && ! status )  { 
   // metastate captured: ok 
   std::cout << "\nOK: Retrieved value: " << *value ;
  }

if ( ! value &&   status )  { 
   // metastate captured: error 
   // in this example status contains an error code
   std::cout << "\nRead error: " <<  my::status_message(*status) ;
  }

if ( ! value && ! status )  { 
   // metastate captured: empty 
   std::cout << "\nField is empty." ;
  }

 ```
Please do note, using the same paradigm it is almost trivial to imagine that same calling algorithm in e.g. JavaScript inside some node.js, calling the module written in C++ returning valstat object that JavaScript will understand. 

Let us emphasize: Not all possible metastates need to be captured by the caller each and every time. It entirely depends on the API "contract", on the logic of the calling site, on application requirements and such.

### 5.2. the API point of view

Requirements permitting, API implementers are free to choose if they will use and return them all, one,two or three metastates. In this scenario they return all of them.

```cpp
// implementation in the API namespace
template<typename T>
my::valstat<T, my::stat > 
full_field_info
(database::row row_, std::string_view field_name ) 
// not throwing exceptions.
            noexcept 
{
   // sanity check
   if ( field_name.size() < 1) 
    // return ERROR metastate
      return { {}, my::stat::name_empty };      

   // using some hypothetical database API
   database::field_descriptor field = row_.fetch( field_name ) ;
 
    if ( field.in_error() ) 
    // return ERROR metastate
      return { {}, (my::stat::db_api_error)field.error() };      

    if ( field.is_empty() ) 
    // empty field is not an error
    // return EMPTY metastate 
      return { {}, {} };      

   // db type will have to be cast into the type T
   // we assume T properly handles move/copy etc.
   T field_value{} ; 
   if ( false == field.data( field_value ) )
   // return ERROR metastate 
      return { {},  (my::stat::type_cast_failed)field.error() }; 

 // API contract requires signalling if 'special' value is found
  if ( special_value( field_value ) )       
  // return INFO metastate
   return { field_value, my::stat::special_value }; 

// just some value 
// OK metastate 
   return { field_value, {} }; 
}
```
Basically function returning the metastate is simply returning two fields structure. With all the advantages and disadvantages imposed by the core language rules. Any kind of home grown but functional valstat will work too. As long as callers can capture the metastates by using its two fields.

Using thread safe abstractions, or asynchronous processing is also not stopping the adopters to return the metastates from their API's.

## 6. Conclusions

*Fundamentally, the burden of proof is on the proposers.* — B. Stroustrup, [[11]](#ref11)

Hopefully proving the evolution of error code handling into returns handling does not need much convincing. There are many real returns handling situations where the metastate paradigm can be used. As an common call returns handling paradigm, metastate requires to be ubiquitously adopted to become truly an instrumental to widespread interoperability. From micro to macro levels. From inside the code to inter component calls.

"metastate" is multilingual in nature. Thus adopters from any imperative language are free to implement it in any way they wish too. The requirement is: interoperability. 

Developing standard C++ code using standard library, but in restricted run-time environments, is what one might call a "situation"[[3](#ref3)][[4](#ref4)][[11](#ref11)]. Author is certain readership knows quite well why is that situation considered unresolved. There is no need for yet another [tractate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tractate), in the form of proposal to try and explain the background. 

Authors primary aim is to achieve widespread adoption of this paradigm. As shown metastate is more than solving the "error-signalling problem"[[11](#ref11)]. It is an paradigm, instrumental in solving the often hard and orthogonal set of run-time requirements described in the [motivation section](#2-motivation).

*"A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something ... When you change paradigms, you're changing how you think about something..."* [vocabulary.com](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/paradigm)

metastate aims high. And the scope of metastate is rather wide. But it is a humble paradigm. It is just an simple and effective way of building bridges over one deeply fragmented part of the vast C++ territory. While imposing extremely little on adopters implementations and leaving the non-adopters to "proceed as before".

Obstacles to metastate paradigm adoption are far from just technical. But here is at least an immediately usable attempt to chart the way out.

## 8. Appendix A

*To me, one of the hallmarks of good programming is that the code looks so simple that you are tempted to dismiss the skill of the author. Writing good clean understandable code is hard work whatever language you are using -- Francis Glassborow*

Value of the programming paradigm is best understood by seeing the code using it. The more the merrier. Here are a few more simple examples illustrating the metastate applicability. All following the [initial set of requirements](#2-motivation).

### 8.1. metastate as a solution for known and difficult problems

An perhaps very elegant solution to the "index out of bounds" problem. Using [my::valstat](#41-myvalstat) as already defined above. 

```cpp
// inside some sequence like container
// see the my::valstat above.
 my::valstat< T , std::errc >
     operator [] ( size_t idx_ ) noexcept
    {
        if ( ! ( idx_ < size_ ) )
        /* ERROR metastate */
        return { {}, my::errc::invalid_argument };
        /* OK metastate */
        return { data_[idx_] , {} };
    }
```
That pattern alone resolves few difficult and well known C++ std lib design issues.
```cpp
auto [ value, status ] = my_vector[42] ;

// first stage: check the metastates
if ( value  )  { /* we are here just if metastate is OK     */ }
if ( status )  { /* we are here just if metastate is ERROR  */ }
```
No exceptions, no `assert()` and no `exit()` in release builds.

As an very real example of the std lib situation in the presence of "no exception" requirement we might show the known [MS STL](https://github.com/microsoft/STL) solution to the above: 

```cpp
// MS STL <vector> approx line#2590
    _NODISCARD reference at(size_type _Off) {
        if (size() <= _Off) {
            _Xran();
        }
        return (*this)[_Off];
    }
```

Where in the presence of `_HAS_EXCEPTIONS == 0` , `_Xran()`  ultimately raises the [structured exception](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/structured-exception-handling-c-cpp?view=vs-2019). The whole MS STL is, in that scenario, in the non standard C++ shape.

Deploying the metastate paradigm above might not result in such a controversial std lib design.

### 8.2. Fully functional valstat type, does not have to use std::optional or std::valstat.

Let us assume we need to write a layer of safe proxies to some C run time (CRT) functions. 

We shall first declare a valstat like template for this specific context.

```cpp
namespace crt {
template<typename T>
struct [[nodiscard]]  errno_valstat final {
   	
using value_field_type  = T ;
// We want to decouple users 
// from the existence of the `errno`. 
using status_field_type = std::errc ;

		value_field_type   value;
		status_field_type  status;
} ;
} // crt
```
That one narrow context, valstat variant might be used in a myriad of API's, internally facing the CRT. All returning the metastates, carried by the definitions of that one template: `errno_valstat<T>` . Examples:

```cpp
// 
errno_valstat<const char *> safe_read_line ( FILE * ) noexcept ;

errno_valstat<double> safe_sqrt( double * ) noexcept ;

errno_valstat<const char *> safe_strdup( const char * ) noexcept ;
```
And here are some possible legal usages from insides of those functions.
```cpp
// EMPTY metastate result -- from safe_read_line ( FILE * ) ;
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { nullptr , std::errc{} } ;

// INFO metastate  result -- from safe_read_line (FILE *)
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { & value_ , std::errc::is_a_directory } ;

// OK metastate  result -- from safe_sqrt( double ) API
crt::errno_valstat<double *> { & value_ , std::errc{} } ;

// ERROR metastate  result -- from safe_strdup( const char *)
crt::errno_valstat<const char *> { nullptr , std::errc::invalid_argument } ;

```
The caller using any of the above imagined crt proxy functions, can follow the same metastate capturing idiom.
```cpp
// calling any of the three above
// value is a pointer , status is std::errc 
auto [value, status] = any_of_the_three_above ();

  if (   value &&   status )  { /* info */ }
  if (   value && ! status )  { /* ok   */ }
  if ( ! value &&   status )  { /* error*/ }
  if ( ! value && ! status )  { /* empty*/ }
```
That is an example to show and explain the suitability of metastate in various non standard contexts. Let's see how would `modern_fopen` might be actually implemented.

```cpp
// 
inline crt::errno_valstat<FILE*> 
  modern_fopen(const char* name_, const char* mode_) 
noexcept
{
    FILE* fp_{};
    int ec_ = fopen_s(&fp_, name_, mode_);

    if (NULL == fp_)
        // the ERROR metastate
        return { {} ,  errno_to_errc(ec_) }; 

    // OK metastate
    return { fp_, {} }; // OK metastate
}
```
Very simple but fully metastate enabled. The usage:
```cpp
// C++17 if() syntax
if (auto [ filep , errc ] 
    = modern_fopen( "non_existent_file" , "w+" ); 
    filep )
{
   // return processing stage one done
   // "value" fiels is not empty
   // stage two:
   // filep is a FILE *, here
   fprintf( filep, "OK" ) ;
}  
else {
   // return processing stage one
   // "value" field is empty
   // check the "status" field occupancy
   if ( errc )  {
   // no empty, we can use the content of the status field
   auto message = errc_to_string (errc);
   }
}
```

Above decouples from decades of "special return values" ,`errno` globals and POSIX "hash defines" lurking inside any C++ code base today. That is done before.

In addition to that, metastate enabled proxy functions, in front of the CRT legacy, are delivering resilient, uniform and interoperable solution. Available immediately.
